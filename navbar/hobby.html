      <p><strong>Optical Head-Mounted Displays for Laser Safety Eyewear, U.S. Patent Number 10,690,918.  An augmented Reality application that allows laser operators to see a beam while wearing safety glasses designed to completely filter the beam.  
        (NASA Langley collaboration)</strong> <br> Laser safety glasses are designed to filter a particular color laser beam in order to protect user vision.  Unfortunately this also renders the beam invisible 
        which makes it difficult to align a beam with it's target. This patent proposes a system where the beam is rendered on an Augmented Reality (AR) headset in a color which 
        is visible through the laser safety glasses.  <br>
