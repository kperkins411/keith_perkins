      <p><strong>Augmented Reality Laser Safety Googles</strong>  NASA Langley prototype. Laser operators typically wear safety glasses that filter the color of a laser beam so that it is invisible to the operator.  But in order to align a beam with its target, operators need to see it.  This application enables laser operators to continue to see a laser through safety glasses by means of an Augmented Reality (AR) headset that presents a view of the laser in a different color.  The beam is filtered by the safety glasses yet still visible to the operator.<br>  This application is intended to run on Android based AR headsets and handhelds.  It was developed for and tested on: Vuzix M300, Vuzix M100 and Google Glass (explorer edition).  It is capable of aggregating mutiple bluetooth and wireless remote camera and instrumentation feeds for display. <Br>Patent pending, NASA collaboration, application repository is private.<br/>
