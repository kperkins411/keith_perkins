      <p><strong>Augmented Reality Laser Safety Googles Prototype</strong>  NASA Langley prototype. Laser operators typically wear safety glasses that filter the wavelength of a laser so that it is effectively invisible to the operator.  But in order to align a beam with a target operators need to see it, which leads to the risky behavior of peaking around the safety glasses.  This application enables laser operators to still see a laser through safety glasses by means of an Augmented Reality (AR) headset that presents a view of the laser in a different color that is not filtered by the operators safety glasses.  Presto! Beam is filtered by the safety glasses but still visible to the operator.<br>  This application is intended to run on Android based AR headsets and handhelds.  It was developed for and tested on: Vuzix M300, Vuzix M100, Google Glass (explorer edition).  It is capable of aggregating mutiple remote camera and instrumentation feeds for display. <Br>Patent pending, NASA collaboration, application repository is private.<br/>
