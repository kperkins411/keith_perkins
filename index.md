### Augmented Reality
[ C++ - AR Marker Demo]( https://github.com/kperkins411/AR_Marker_Demo) An Augmented Reality app that demonstrates basic computer vision concepts such as greyscaling, thresholding, edge detection, homography, corner detection...its a long list.  It paints a 3D image on any detected markers. See images and video for demo.<BR>


## Computer Vision
[ Android,OpenCV - Image processing pipeline including edge detection, color space shifting, and overlay text display ]( https://github.com/kperkins411/OpenCVEdgeTest)<BR>
[ Android,OpenCV - App that looks at an image, recognizes all coins and determines the total value. ]( https://github.com/kperkins411/Count-coins-using-OpenCV)<BR>


## Current Research
AR lazer googles project.  A way to use AR headsets to show lazer beam location through light filtering lazer safety goggles.(Patent applied for, NASA collaboration, application repo is private)

## Student Projects I've mentored 
<B>Body Measurements</B> - A virtual tailoring measurement system.  Uses Microsoft Kinnect to generate a 3D body avatar, then openGL and C++ to take perfect body measurements<br>
Better Amber Alert - Uses bluetooth trackers and crowdsourced app to automate finding lost/kidnapped souls<br>
AR-Based Color Correction and Object Detection - A masters thesis that developed algorithms to assist people with colorblindness.  <BR>
Amazon Alexa- Voice application and skill for enterprise database queries<br>
