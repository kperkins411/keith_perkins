## Machine Learning
**[ clustering demos ]( https://github.com/kperkins411/Clustering_Demos)** Python,  K-means and DBSCAN clustering demos for segmenting and displaying 3 dimensional data<BR>

## Computer Vision
**[ C++ - AR Marker Demo]( https://github.com/kperkins411/AR_Marker_Demo)** An Augmented Reality app that demonstrates basic computer vision concepts such as greyscaling, thresholding, edge detection, homography, corner detection...its a long list.  It paints a 3D image on any detected markers. See images and video for demo.<BR>
**[ Android (Java),OpenCV - Image processing pipeline ]( https://github.com/kperkins411/OpenCVEdgeTest)** A class and tester that implements an image processing pipeline. Performs edge detection, color space shifting, and text display overlaying a loaded image.  <BR>
**[ Python,OpenCV - Coin Counter]( https://github.com/kperkins411/Count-coins-using-OpenCV)** An application that recognizes coins in an image using hough circles and then sums the total value of them. ]<BR>

## Current Research
**AR Laser Googles Project**  A flexible android application that enables laser operators to see laser beams using AR headsets that are otherwise blocked by safety goggles. Patent applied for, NASA collaboration, application repository is private.

## Student Projects I've mentored 
**Body Measurements** - A virtual tailoring measurement system.  Uses Microsoft Kinnect to generate a 3D body avatar, then openGL and C++ to take perfect body measurements<br>
**Better Amber Alert** - An application that uses bluetooth trackers, and a client and server application to crowdsource and automate finding lost/kidnapped souls<br>
**AR-Based Color Correction and Object Detection** - A masters thesis that developed algorithms to assist people with colorblindness.  <BR>
**Amazon Alexa data query agent**- Voice application and skill for enterprise database queries<br>
